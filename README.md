## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to better style lists and tables, as well as the usage of different display styles (inline, block). I also applied my knowledge on media queries to make a responsive design.

### Continued development

I would like to explore more how to use the different display types, and the combination of inline and block elements inside the same block.
